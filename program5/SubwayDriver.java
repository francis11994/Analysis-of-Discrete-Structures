/**
 * Driver class for project 5.
 *
 * If you do the extra credit, and can support deletion, invoke the driver with
 * flag "--extra-credit" as the first command-line argument.  Otherwise, we
 * assume deletion is not supported.
 *
 * This reads commands from standard input.  The commands are as follows:
 * 
 * "input x y s"
 * ... where x and y are arbitrary int coordinates, and s is a string
 * strictly delimited by whitespace (no way to quote it or escape it).
 * This command creates a graph vertex in the graph at coordinates (x,y)
 * and associates string s with it.  In this project we assume it represents
 * a subway station, and s represents the name of the station, not necessarily
 * unique.  If there is already a station at coordinates (x,y) then this
 * command updates the name string.  The command produces no output.
 *
 * "Adjacent x1 y1 x2 y2"
 * . . . where x1, y1, x2, and y2 are arbitrary int coordinates.
 * If there is a station at coordinates (x1, y1) and also a station at
 * coordinates (x2, y2), then this command creates an undirected graph
 * edge between the vertices, regardless of any other geometric concerns.
 * The edge represents a subway tunnel directly connecting the stations.
 * If either station does not exist, the command has no effect.
 * The command produces no output.
 *
 * "Route x1 y1 x2 y2"
 * . . . where x1, y1, x2, and y2 are arbitrary int coordinates.
 * If there is a station at coordinates (x1, y1) and also a station at
 * coordinates (x2, y2), then this command computes a shortest path
 * (i.e., minimum number of stations) between stations.
 * If the start or end station does not exist, or the stations are not
 * connected in the graph, then the command prints "NO PATH"; otherwise
 * the output consists of lines showing the stations along a path
 * in the graph.
 *
 * "Delete x y"
 * This command removes a vertex at (x,y) and its associated edges from
 * the graph.  If there is no station at coordinates (x, y), the command
 * is ignored.  The command produces no output.
 * For this assignment, this command is optional (for extra credit) --
 * see the assignment for details.
 *
 * Example
