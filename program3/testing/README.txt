To run these tests on lectura,
execute the kilotest.bash script in the same directory as your
compiled MultiplyDriver.class file.
The output should match the contents of kilo_answer.txt.
This is how we will test your program.

If you'd like to do further tests, you can execute gen_test.py,
which will produce further similar tests.  The answers are embedded in
the output as script comments, but answer_filter.bash will extract them.

Your program should complete these tests in under three hours.
(Ideally it should complete them in very few minutes.)
